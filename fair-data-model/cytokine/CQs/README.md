# Using Competency Questions for Data Model Verification

This folder contains Competency Questions (Gruninger & Fox, 1995) that were constructed to verify the semantic model. The set of CQs was extracted, refined and answered with support from domain experts and modellers. In literature, CQs are claimed as an efficient way of testing models, since they are based on real questions. It is also argued that CQs help to define design project requirements, such as adherence to process models and identification of stakeholders (Falbo, 2004).

In this folder, CQS are answered in SPARQL queries for reusability purposes. We are aware of the possibility to checking the model by answering CQs using ShEx or Shacl. However, we decided to use SPARQL since queries can be reused in our project and by external users.
